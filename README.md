# clCahnHilliard

This repository contains the OpenCL code that runs the classic model describing phase-separation in for instance alloys, developed by John Cahn and John Hilliard in 1958:

J. W. Cahn and J. E. Hilliard. 1958. Free energy of a nonuniform system. I. Interfacial free energy. Journal of Chemical Physics 28, 258 (1958).

An video of the output of the model can be found on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AGzj1Bu_Ic . This video has been produced by the code in this repository.

To run this model, see the general explanation on the main page: https://johanvandekoppel.github.io
